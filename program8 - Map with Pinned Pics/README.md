Description:  (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, android version ie 10.0)
This application is made just for devices with minimum SDK = 21. 
I ran this application on Samsung S6 edge with Android Version = 7
In main screen of the app you can see a market that shows your current location. 
Data and Location in your device should be on. 
There is camera button on bottom of screen when you click on that you will see the camera and after taking picture you should go back to map and see the picture pinned to the map/

Anything that doesn't work: I think everything works.
