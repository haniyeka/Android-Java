Description: (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, android version ie 10.0)
The application supports SDK version 22 and target SDK version is 29. I tested the application both on PIXEL XL emulator and Samsung Galaxy S6 edge with android version 7.0.
In start page of the application there are two buttons on for OnePlayer option and other is for TwoPlayer option. After choosing one of the buttons it goes to another activity to choose the Player then game starts. Also, there is a button to restart game. And when game finished it identifies the winner. 

Anything that doesn't work: Everything works

* Player X does not always play first **(-2 points)**

The program instructions state that "Player X always goes first". When choosing to play against a computer, if the player selects the O marker, then the computer should make the first move rather than the player. Other than that, everything works great!
