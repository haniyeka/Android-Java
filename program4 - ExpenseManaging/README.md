Program #4

Name: Haniye Kashgarani 

Cosc 5730 

Description: (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, pixel 2, or android version 11)
This application support minimum SDK version 14 and the target SDK version is 30. I tested the application both in PIXEL XL emulator and Samsung S6 edge phone with android version 7.0. When application is open, it shows a recycleView for list of expenses. You can add, delete, edit the expense. The fab button is for adding new entry, the edit button shows an Alert Dialog to edit the selected entry. (all the previous value will be shown in the alert dialog)
The delete button deletes the entry. Also, the fab button is to go to new fragment to add new entry. The list of categories can be shown by touching the category EditText

Anything that doesn't work: Everything works.
