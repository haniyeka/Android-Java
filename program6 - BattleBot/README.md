Description:  (how to run the program, phone/emulator screen size, android version ie 10.0)
I tried running the program both in Samsung Galaxy S6 edge and Samsung Galaxy S7. One of the phones has Android version 7 and other one has Android versio 8.
To run the program, in the first activity you need to enter the IP address, then click button. In the next activity, you can see a CONNECT button, click that you will connect to the server. Then press "SET BOT" button to set your bot in the screen. In this activity you have 2 joysticks, the left one is for moving and the right one is for shooting. 
Application will rotate your sceen to LANDSCAPE mode. The minimum SDK version to run the program is 16 and the target SDK is 30. 

Anything that doesn't work:
