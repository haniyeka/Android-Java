Program # 1

Name: Haniye Kashgarani

Cosc 5730

Description:

When starting the program if you enter your name and click the Welcome button, you will see a Snackbar Message showing a Welcome message. Also, I used Log.e which by clicking the button you will see the message in LogCat. I checked running the progran on just an emulator -- Pixel XL with API 30 -- and it works great. The target Sdk version of the program is 30 and the minimum supporting SDK version is 16. The fragment is using the dynamic loading the fragment instead of loading from XML. The screen size of the emulator is 5.5 inches.
